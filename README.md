# GitHub Pages Vibe

This repository provides a minimal landing page implemented with React and
styled-components. It displays a hero image, navigation links, and embedded
YouTube and Twitch streams.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   The generated static files will be placed in the `dist/` directory and can
   be published with GitHub Pages.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – entry HTML file used by Vite.
- `src/` – React source files.
- `package.json` – lists dependencies and build scripts.
